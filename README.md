This repository contains the latest methods and datasets of DUT(Dalian University of Technology) in the underwater vison.

So far, we have released the following datasets for underwater object detection and semantic segmentation:

- [UDD](https://github.com/chongweiliu/UDD_Official) for underwater object detection.
- [DUO](https://github.com/chongweiliu/DUO)  for underwater object detection. 
- [DUT-USEG](https://github.com/baxiyi/DUT-USEG) for underwater semantic segmentation.

This project will continue to be updated!
